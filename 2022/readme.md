Advent of Code 2022

Trying to do OCaml until I get tired of it and have to use Python.

Remember:
+ ;; ends a block
+ quit with `exit 0;;`
+ `#use "program.ml"` is a special toplevel instruction to load a file

After day 2, I've set up a bit of a template. Using `utop -init 2022/solutions-ocaml/X.ml`, this automatically prints out the result and quits utop.
